# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

https://lmp-beep.github.io/04-CodeQuiz/

Special Thanks to my tutor Dennis Itua and my TA Matthew Carpenter for helping me get through this!

This assignment was the hardest one yet. I drew a lot of inspiration from youTube and from others posting their quizzes online. 

I originally had some color changing effects that were really neat at first, but then it just got too complicated with the js, so I removed them.



Known Problems:
Timer goes into negative instead of ending game.

High Score Page should list names in the order of highest score first.

Would have liked to figure out the "button turns red for wrong" and "button turns green for correct" function.

Would have liked to add keyboard event of hitting enter key in addition to clicking submit after entering name.

Would have liked to figure out how to add a modal for the high scores.
