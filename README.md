# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

https://lmp-beep.github.io/04-CodeQuiz/

Special Thanks to my tutor Dennis Itua and my TA Matthew Carpenter for helping me get through this!

I originally had some color changing effects that were really neat at first, but then it just got too complicated with the js, so I removed them.

This assignment was the hardest one yet. I drew a lot of inspiration from youTube and from others posting their quizzes online. I actually feel like I copied and pasted a lot more than in previous assignments, which means I understand my code even less. This class gives us no time to absorb what we have learned before moving on to the next lesson. I feel like all I am doing is copying and pasting from other students just to get the assignment done, instead of taking the time to learn what I am doing, even though I spent over 40 hours on this assignment.


Known Problems:
Timer goes into negative instead of ending game.

High Score Page should list names in the order of highest score first.

Would have liked to figure out the "button turns red for wrong" and "button turns green for correct" function.

Would have liked to add keyboard event of hitting enter key in addition to clicking submit after entering name.

Would have liked to figure out how to add a modal for the high scores.
